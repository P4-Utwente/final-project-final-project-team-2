# Final Project P4
For all documentation related to your final project. You can use it for other purposes, but you do not have to.

The wiki should introduce the code base, discuss where it comes from, its size, its relevance, its maturity, whether it is open or proprietary, professionally developed, or by volunteers.

It should furthermore present briefly the CI/CD system, including the build andversion control system. It should present the static and dynamic analysis tools that will integrated, as well as the linked management systems.

Explain how developers work with this system, and the envisioned work-flow.
